The lsnstat package was created to facilitate access to the macro_data service of the La Societe Nouvelle API.

It ensures a fully-disclosed access to all macro-level data used in the La Societe Nouvelle systems :

* default and forecasted footprint values by economic activity ;

* forecasted structural economic data.

Detailed documentation and metholodology are availables online : https://docs.lasocietenouvelle.org. 

A specific metholodogical documentation is currently being drafted and will be released on our website :  https://lasocietenouvelle.org.

This package is designed by La 'Societe Nouvelle', a French organization that set up a non financial national information system.
